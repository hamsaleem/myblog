    <p> Wisdom can't be achieved by sitting down and thinking. Wisdom is an action. Only by getting out and living your life can you become wise. Once we start living the obvious becomes clear. That which we embrace and that which we fear are often different only by how far we open our mind.</p>

    <h1> Sweden: Life is Someone Else's Problem </h1>
   <h2>by Kevin Anderson | November 2020 </h2>

   <p>When covered in an S.E.P field an alien spaceship or large pink elephant is easy to ignore. Effectively they become invisible. More to the point, and closer to definition, it is unnoticed because it is Somebody Else's Problem. If your mind cannot accept the inconceivable, then the inconceivable goes unnoticed because it does not exist. If it does, as Douglas Adams defines it- "The Somebody Else's Problem field... relies on people's natural predisposition not to see anything they don't want to, weren't expecting, or can't explain." The issue is a problem for someone other than you. </p>
   <p>This truth can be found, like all good truths, in the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy. It is an idea grounded in recent science. A CNN article cites clinical psychologist Bhavna Jani-Negandhi who states that "whenever people are presented with an extremely frightening scenario, previous research has shown that they switch off." The CNN reporter is pointing to people who ignore the current global pandemic. Yet when the company invented the S.E.P. they could have been taking about Sweden. Not the country, but the people. The Swedish culture has perfected the art of surrounding the most important of situations in an S.E.P. field. Let us look at some of these from the corner of our eye, for this is the only way to bypass the field. </p>
   <p>First, we begin in the middle of the twentieth century. World War II was raging around Europe. Millions of people were dying. The Nazi blitzkrieg had devastated the land. True to nature Sweden made the 1940s an S.E.P. Colloquially, this has been termed - declaring neutrality. In this neutral environment Nazi trains could ship troops across Sweden without hindrance. Iron could be traded with both Germany and Britain without paradox. Thousands could lose their lives and Sweden continued with business as usual. The horrors around were inconceivable, the fragile mind could not comprehend. As such the perspective field went up and the war became a problem for someone else. This partially explains why in the new millennium Swedish newspapers are still publishing articles on whether the Nazis will invade. The field is slowly dissolving, and glimpses of reality are being spotted. Predictions can be cast on when the Swedish government will act against Hitler. </p>
   <p>The second field was raised when Sweden declared neutrality during the COVID-19 pandemic. In January as the world became aware of the problem the Swedes closed their eyes. In February as social-distancing and face-mask policies were implemented around the world, Sweden decided the problem was for someone else. March brought border closures, but Sweden remained open. In principle. By default, the country's borders were closed because all neighbors had prevented Swedes from traveling. The S.E.P. had gone up. Sweden could not conceive of a global pandemic, so it did not exist. Again, declaring neutrality COVID-19 was designated as someone else's problem. By November Swedes blinked and found the field was wavering. New restrictions were put in place that reflected European actions against the virus. Yet Sweden phrased the issue more delicately. 'Recommendations' were 'advice' to stop the spread. Hygiene methods were practically the same as they had been for decades. The only real change was that people should now stand two meters apart...If you wish. No longer a national S.E.P. field, the virus had become shrouded in individual S.E.P cloaks. It was not until January 2021, (yes, a whole year after the global crises began) that the Swedish Riksdag passed legislation allowing most of the same community restrictions that were in action around the world. The image was still abstract, still hidden, still in the hands of individuals who could not comprehend the extremely frightening scenario. </p>
   <p>Which brings us to the third cultural S.E.P. for Sweden. As a country of individuals everyone has adopted a policy of making an S.E.P. of normal human interactions. I am sitting at at work as I write this. For eight weeks I have been here in an office of a hundred people. Some working from home, others maintaining distance while working, all sharing couches and personal space during afternoon tea. Yet the number of people who said 'hello' to me is countable on one hand and a half a foot. Three co-workers share a desk behind mine, half the length of a cricket pitch away and in plain sight. None have acknowledged that I exist. I do not concern them. I am not part of their operational status. To cite Ford Prefect, "An SEP is something we cannot see, or do not see, or our brain does not let us see, because we think that it's somebody else's problem. That is what SEP means. Somebody Else’s Problem. The brain just edits it out, it's like a blind spot." Like important global events on the national level, I am a blind spot to the Swedes in this office. </p>
   <p>Ok, sure, we could suggest that I am covered in the S.E.P. field. Or point out that I could just be a person not worth giving the time of day to. But how would the Swede's know this if they have not spent thirty seconds talking to me? More so, how could they know when they lower their heads while passing in a narrow corridor? If this is an issue for me, then it must be worse for the refuges and other minority groups experiencing isolation. Those or the real victims of the Swedish S.E.P. The field applies to each other as well for the fact is that Swedes live alone more than any other culture. The BBC claims that this is by choice. It is suggested that the Swedes are happy even as they toil with mental anxiety. Ensam är Stark! This aversion to human interaction is a deeply ingrained cultural perspective. There is a 'natural predisposition not to see anything they don't want to, weren't expecting, or 'can't explain'. To a Swede everyone is a large pink elephant and thus an S.E.P. Anything not themself is inconceivable to the Swedish mind. In this way Swedes have declared neutrality on life and effectively made it an S.E.P. </p>
   <p>Given this national and individual attitude the fourth S.E.P. should be unsurprising. This field is so strong that it is impossible to talk about. I have looked from the corner of both eyes. I have turned away and snapped back sharply. I have even tried to park a giant spaceship on a Swedish cricket pitch. This did not work because I was unable to find a Swedish cricket pitch. Regardless of sporting facilities, the point is that there is a deep, impenetrable field around Swedes and the country that it should be of concern to both the inhabitants and the rest of the world. If not, then very soon it will be obvious that someone has painted the whole country pink. No, that would not be obvious. If the country was pink then the world would walk round it, over it, past it and never notice that it was there. Perhaps the fourth S.E.P. field is already developing over Sweden. Perhaps the world is preparing to declare Sweden 'someone else's problem'. </p>
