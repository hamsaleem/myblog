    <p> Wisdom can't be achieved by sitting down and thinking. Wisdom is an action. Only by getting out and living your life can you become wise. Once we start living the obvious becomes clear. That which we embrace and that which we fear are often different only by how far we open our mind.</p>

    <h1> Call of Twitter: Lovecraft, IT and social media.</h1>
   <h2>by Kevin Anderson | January 2021 </h2>

   <p class="note"> THE most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human 	mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in 	the midst of 	black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should 	voyage far. The sciences, 	each straining in its own direction, have hitherto 	harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated 	knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful 	position therein, that we shall either go mad from the 	revelation or flee 	from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.</p>

   <p>So begins the Call of Cthulhu. The short story by H.P. Lovecraft has spawned everything from fan-sites and computer games to a fanatical following, some of whom believe the tale is real. A century after he typed these words perhaps the human mind has voyaged far enough across the seas of science that the disconnect between moral and knowledge has snapped for all eternity. In a week where the President of the United States has been prohibited from speaking on social media, it is time to consider how near humans are to fleeing into the safety of a new dark age. </p>

<p>Since humans landed on the moon their own digital universe has expanded beyond belief. It is often noted that each mobile phone has more processing power than the machines that launched our ancestors to the heavens. With the coupling of computers to each other a new world was created. The networks added, multiplied and multiplied again. Innumerable electronic tentacles flitting around the world, embracing all they touch with the loving embrace of squelching, opaqueness. There appears no end to the internet and the knowledge stored at our fingertips. It is a cosmos so vast that humans can never appreciate its depths. There is no biological way to correlate all its contents. </p>

<p>Prior to the digital age humans lived on an island of ignorance. As immune to their surrounds as creatures of the ocean depths are to the sun. Worse than the vastness of infinity, is the turbulent oceans of hatred swelling in the smallest community. Until the advent of social media it was the peer pressure of society that generally held severe opinions in check. It is one of the reasons that killers can hide in sunshine and school shootings happen from seemingly blue skies. The anonymity of handles, avatars and fake accounts has freed the inner demons lurking in the room next door. </p>

<p>This is where the sciences have commenced piecing together strands of dissociated knowledge. Physics, electronics, chemistry, metallurgy, have been joined by programmers of algorithms to open the world to unrestrained commentary of the most advanced inhabitants. Once separate and combative against each other, these spheres of knowledge are now united in their goal of constructing new avenues for society. Like the proverbial Tower of Babel, when humans work together the Gods get jealous. </p>

<p>In this unity humans have been exposed to truly horrifying vistas of reality. These are not a cosmic horror, they are bubbling under the surface of every community where humansâ€™ dwell. Social media opened our eyes to how immense the realm of hate can be. Worse, it has demonstrated that anyone can be the terrifying troll. The grandfather, the beautiful neighbour, the mega-star, the ugly troll on the bus. If every human has the demon of hate inside, then it is inevitable that the talons scratch through the rock aorta walls. </p>

<p>As each day greets human eyes with widening horror there can be no doubt that Lovecraft predicted the future. To be precise he understood that humans foster and breed the evil they dread. Social media has opened the spectrum on an infinity of black seas, an uncontrollable cosmos. At the moment humans are going mad as they piece together the dissociated knowledge of themselves. Only the future will tell if they will flee into peace and safety. As yet they have not realised that it is a possibility to turn off and initiate a new dark age. It would not matter. The eyes are expanded to the vastness of cruelty. There is only one salvation. All hail the mighty Cthulhu! </p>
