    <p> Wisdom can't be achieved by sitting down and thinking. Wisdom is an action. Only by getting out and living your life can you become wise. Once we start living the obvious becomes clear. That which we embrace and that which we fear are often different only by how far we open our mind.</p>

    <h1> Separate, Erase and Rewrite</h1>
   <h2>by Kevin Anderson | April 2021 </h2>


   <p>When I was younger a scandal rocked the music world. The King of Pop had been accused of child molestation. Michael Jackson jokes circulated the world in what would today make him the King of Memes. What do Michael Jackson and McDonald's have in common? Both are a forty-year-old piece of meat between ten-year-old buns. Crude. Funny, perhaps. True, not likely. Spread like wildfire – absolutely. Humans have an innate capacity for rudeness coupled with speaking before thinking. In the 1990's a career could be ruined in weeks because of tasteless comments. Today the internet reduces that to days. Combined with massive multi-player social movements this timeframe becomes hours. </p>

   <p>In my younger years I believed that the man should be separated from the music. The quality of Jackson's work should never be forgotten. From Ben, through Bad, to Dangerous. He had an ability to shape music, culture, and society in a way that few can. Did it really matter what he did in his spare time? Well, yes. It is never possible to defend reprehensible law-breaking. If, and I clarify – IF, Jackson was a pedophile then his actions cannot be forgiven. </p>
   
   <p>But so too is his music fantastic. 'Thriller' is among the biggest selling albums of all time setting new standards for performance. The slow, bluesy notes of Billie Jean speak to generations of listeners. And no one could consider the 1972 innocence of youth in 'Ben' (a song about a rat) to be conceived by an old man who sexually assaulted children. Jackson was only fourteen at the time he recorded it. Should his talent in early years be dismissed because of his accused actions in later years? It is neither legal nor logically possible to convict a person for actions they have yet to conduct. But the 1990's were a weird time. </p>
