    <h1> Separate, Erase and Rewrite</h1>
   <h2>by Kevin Anderson | April 2021 </h2>


   <p>When I was younger a scandal rocked the music world. The King of Pop had been accused of child molestation. Michael Jackson jokes circulated the world in what would today make him the King of Memes. What do Michael Jackson and McDonald's have in common? Both are a forty-year-old piece of meat between ten-year-old buns. Crude. Funny, perhaps. True, not likely. Spread like wildfire – absolutely. Humans have an innate capacity for rudeness coupled with speaking before thinking. In the 1990's a career could be ruined in weeks because of tasteless comments. Today the internet reduces that to days. Combined with massive multi-player social movements this timeframe becomes hours. </p>

   <p>In my younger years I believed that the man should be separated from the music. The quality of Jackson's work should never be forgotten. From Ben, through Bad, to Dangerous. He had an ability to shape music, culture, and society in a way that few can. Did it really matter what he did in his spare time? Well, yes. It is never possible to defend reprehensible law-breaking. If, and I clarify – IF, Jackson was a pedophile then his actions cannot be forgiven. </p>
   
   <p>But so too is his music fantastic. 'Thriller' is among the biggest selling albums of all time setting new standards for performance. The slow, bluesy notes of Billie Jean speak to generations of listeners. And no one could consider the 1972 innocence of youth in 'Ben' (a song about a rat) to be conceived by an old man who sexually assaulted children. Jackson was only fourteen at the time he recorded it. Should his talent in early years be dismissed because of his accused actions in later years? It is neither legal nor logically possible to convict a person for actions they have yet to conduct. But the 1990's were a weird time. </p>
   
   <p>Then things started to get complicated. More and more accusations were cast at musicians and celebrities whose fame rose in different decades and on different continents. Gary Glitter had some of the biggest hits of the late 1979's. 'I'm the leader of the gang', 'Rock and Roll', 'Didn't know I loved you till I saw you rock and roll'. He too fell foul of life and has subsequently been found guilty of taking advantage of his celebrity status with under-age children. It brings a new meaning to some of his lyrics. From the 1973 song 'I love you love me': </p>

   <i> <p> We are still together after all that we have been through. They tried to tell you I was not the boy for you. They did not like my hair, the clothes I love to wear. They did not realize that I was 	strong enough for two. </p> </i>

   <p>Perhaps you were not the boy because you were actually a MAN and your sexual target was a BOY. And your hair and clothes were a generation out of fashion. Even being 'strong enough for two' implies that you were twice as old as your lover. Another line needs no explanation: </p>
   
     <p> <i>They said I would not dare, to show how much I care... </i></p> 
   
   <p>Meanwhile we will avoid 'Do you want to touch me' like the plague. </p>
   
   <p>Before you accuse me of perpetrating meme-like gossip, I suggest that what I am doing is mere literature analysis. It is taking the lyrics and searching for the author's intent. I am not trying to ruin Glitter's career in advance of evidence. His career was over when a jury found him guilty of his crimes. </p>
   
   <p>Allow me to continue with the problematic element. I still like the song. It is catchy, soulful, and emotional. Glitter did not shape society as Jackson did. But his individuals’ songs are entertaining. </p>
   
   <p>As I age and become more knowledgeable, I start to rationalize differently. Should we separate the man from the music? Maybe it is just enough to acknowledge both talent and criminality without going further. If someone covered Glitter's songs, could they be revived anew and returned to their innocent light? Ed Sheeran may sing -” Come on, come on, come on. Do you want to be in my gang, my gang, my gang?” And Justin Beiber could return from drug rehab to caress us with” did you miss me while I was away? Did you hang my picture on your wall?” </p>
   
   <p>Could we appreciate the music again? Or will we drown in a sea of sarcasm, overwhelmed by waves of irony? </p>
   
   <p>The answer I feel leans towards the negative. Copyright and royalties are funneled from music purchases into the back-pockets of the creators of these fabulous tunes. By buying music written by Glitter, regardless of who performs the song, we fund court cases in which he seeks to escape justice for his actions against children. Assuming he is guilty then we, the listening public, become indirectly complicit in defending his evil habit. </p>
   
   <p>So therefore, we should not be continuing to listen to his music. There may even be a case for removing albums which have featured Glitter's songs from the market, streaming websites and even history. Do use a controversial term- should we cancel the music of pedophiles? </p>
   
   <p>Do not answer that yet. The white rabbit has just arrived at the Mad Hatter's tea-party and we are about to fall down the hole. Rolf Harris has now been convicted and jailed for sexual molestation of children. Harris is an iconic figure of Australian television and music. The inventor of the wobble board (the idea of shaking a piece of cardboard and calling it a musical instrument). He is also the creator of many cultural staples of Australian identity. 'Six white boomers' is a classic summer Christmas carol for the land down under. It is one of the first carols to reflect on something other than snow and sleighbells. 'Jake the Peg' makes every young pirate smile. Like Glitter some of Harris's songs raise eyebrows. 'Tie me kangaroo down sport' has a fearful ring for anyone Harris ever called Skippy. The war song 'Two little Boys' must be thought of carefully considering they are playing with their two little toys. </p>
   
   <p>To recognize the evils of Harris's action, Australian cultural identity must change. No more must these fun, educational and trivial songs be played. They must be erased from history because of sexual misconduct against consenting minors. Such is life. Now more than even Australia needs Kylie! </p>
   
   <p>The rabbit hole twists into Hollywood. In an unprecedented move Kevin Spacey has been physically erased from a completed movie. Allegations of an unwarranted sexual advance committed by Spacey thirty years ago emerged. The actor called it a drunken incident. Oh, and by the way, I am gay – is not the way that Spacey should have concluded his tweet. Almost instantaneously Spacey's television show was canceled by Netflix then Ridley Scott decided to re-shoot parts of a movie with a new actor. Spacey was to be removed. The re-filming was then conducted less than a month before release. Scott is now nominated for Best Director for the movie and Spacey's career is in ruins. </p>
   
   <p>With a precedence now set for trial by social media there is a clear trail to be followed whereby erasure should occur for all films, music and books where an actor is accused of sexual misconduct. 'The Usual Suspects' is a fantastic movie from the 1990's but now should be partially re-shot to remove Spacey from it. So too with 'The Negotiator' and 'Seven' and 'American Beauty'. To ensure complete erasure his awards for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor should be returned and history rewritten to deliver the awards to second place. But then again, Netflix have canceled 'House of Cards' but not removed the five existing seasons from public streaming. I guess erasure only applies when convenient or profitable. Did I mention the acclaim that Scott is gaining for the unprecedented re-shooting? </p>
   
   <p>If Michael Jackson was hung out with crude jokes, then Spacey has entered the new era as Google searchers fail to recognize irony or satire. Memes spread like a virus. They did not hang Spacey, that was humans. But humor is merely a digression. More discussion may flow on the issue. That would add little. </p>
   
   <p>Imagine if erasure was required of politicians who had been convicted of child molestation? Every speech they made, every Parliamentary vote they took would need to be reviewed and recounted. Legal documents would be invalidated, and babies kissed would have to be disinfected. And still the discussion would have to continue. </p>
   
   <p>Should we separate the man from the talent? I have no answer. Perhaps there is no answer. Each person must make their own decisions. Watch or do not watch Spacey films. Listen to or do not listen to Glitter or Jackson. Partake in Australian culture or rewrite it. In the words of Radiohead -” Whatever makes you happy”. Or think very deeply about the consequences of your actions and decide what moral lines you are prepared to cross and what tunes you are willing to dance to. </p>
