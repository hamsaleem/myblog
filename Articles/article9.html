    <p> Wisdom can't be achieved by sitting down and thinking. Wisdom is an action. Only by getting out and living your life can you become wise. Once we start living the obvious becomes clear. That which we embrace and that which we fear are often different only by how far we open our mind.</p>

    <h1> A gesture on a train.</h1>
   <h2>by Kevin Anderson | April 2021 </h2>


<p>Picture the setting. A train, north bound out of Brisbane. Not just a local train travelling a few kilometres. This is a train that will hold its passengers in a steel embrace for nearly three hours. Ok, so it is the same type of train that covers smaller routes, it was just scheduled for a longer trip. But you have an image of how a long-distance train works. It stops every few minutes, on and on, for longer than a football match. </p>

<p>One day I got on this train. To be more accurately I got in the train carriage. Over the long trip, like most humans, I had to make a quick trip to the toilet. Being by myself I did the only logical thing- I turned to the only option available. The stranger, as in never met, lady sitting opposite me. We had been facing towards each other for an hour without speaking a word. It is the politeness of Australian public transport companionship. Smiled warmly and asked humbly if I could intrude beyond the acceptable zone of commuting etiquette. </p>

<p>Could I trouble her to keep an eye on my luggage for a minute? She glanced around as the train trundled roughly along. There were few other passengers. My luggage was a single suitcase. Being that we were in between stations and neither of us were going too far she agreed. That was the first nice gesture of the day. </p>

<p>Returning from the toilet and found that my request had been an icebreaker. For the next little while we chatted as strangers on a train. Joke intended. Then the train was rocked by a flood of rats swishing through the doors, escaping into the metal cage from their daily race, rapidly deserting the city as a sinking ship. In a few minutes there were maybe eight seats left in a space with 70 chairs. Musical chairs for sweaty rats. </p>

<p>Looking down the train I noticed that there were bags on seats, feet on seats, people spread out to ensure that they were comfortable. It is not possible to claim that any single stereotype was causing problems for many were involved. School kids, businessmen, businesswomen, older people, and even a dog or two. Further down the train, beside the toilet I had recently vacated, was a mother and her young son. Standing, loaded with bags, and sweating like the rest of us in the high-speed tin-can, struggling to maintain control the boy. The train rocked around a bend and the mother clutched tighter to the plastic overhead grip. </p>

<p>At the other end of the carriage, I picked my Akubra from the top of my luggage. I had a spare seat beside me. It would have been difficult for an individual in the boarding mass of creatures to see. I did the obvious thing. I walked the length of the carriage. The stares and raised eyebrows of people on both sides of the aisle were obvious as the heat radiating from the scorching summer sun. Some eyes were judgemental. Some eyes were curious. But most eyes were like the look you get on the beach. You know the one where you block someone else's sun for a split second while walking past. It is not anger, just a patronising 'tsk-tsk-tsk' as the social norms were shattered. Why was this guy walking the carriage when he should have been sitting in silence while staring at his phone? </p>

<p>Arriving at my destination I interrupted the endless jostling of the woman juggling her balance, her, and her child.  A look of concern wrinkled her brow as the words left my mouth. Before the end of the sentence her lips were smiling. Would she and her son like to have my seat? </p>

<p>When she accepted, I shared her load, carrying her bags down the length of the crowded carriage as she guided her child after me. This time I can't tell if the stares were of self-centred arrogance or of silent admissions of their own failures. And at the time I did not care. I had done the right thing even if other people had chosen not to. Come to think of it...I still do not care what other people think. </p>

<p>As the mother and her child made herself comfortable in my seat, I balanced myself against the luggage rack. The train rounded the bend, and I tilted my hat lower to block the setting sun. A new surprise occurred as we rolled passed the next station. </p>

<p>Two schoolgirls sitting across the aisle from my original seat adjusted themselves. Dropping their feet from the empty seats opposite them, a young voice spoke up. Would I like to sit? I accepted.  The vibe at our end of the carriage was as bright as spring sun. We all relaxed into a less comfortable position than would have been ideal. A strange old man sharing a confined public space with girls in school uniform, with a mother and child across the aisle beside an elderly woman. We survived the minor inconvenience. We were the living embodiment of Australian society. </p>

<p>One by one, our small society departed. As each person rose, they acknowledged me and each other. Smiles, nods, and good days, enjoy the rest of the trip. It was a wonderful social exchange. It is a perfect example of the way society should work. Our world is often shown to be filled with hate and fear and selfishness and distrust. The is something to be considered- There Are Rational Alternatives. </p>

<p>Trust, morals, and integrity flow like sunlight through an open window. They can be built from the ground with a single gesture. There is always a primary cause to change. Regardless of how other people look at you, someone needs to have the courage to take that first step down the carriage of life. </p>
