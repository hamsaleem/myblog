    <h1> Scomo- The messenger of God.</h1>
   <h2>by Kevin Anderson | April 2021 </h2>

   <p>28 April 2021. The Australian Prime-Minister Scott Morrison, Scomo to his friends, spoke at a Christian gathering. That's fine, as leader of the country he should attend, speak and listen to all groups. It is his job. Unfortunately, Morrison's words were not as patriotic as he might like to think. He decided to tell the world that he is doing God's work. </p>

   <p>Ok, fine. He is religious and is entitled to his faith and opinion. But really? Running a secular, multicultural country like Australia is not doing God's work. The position of Prime-Minister is to represent and serve the bonza larakins that call this beauty land our own. It is not to be God's messenger. </p>
   
   <p>But if that is what the man believes then it is necessary for Australia to hold him accountable. To that end, let us examine how he has demonstrated that he is doing God's work. </p>
   
   <p>May 2019. Morrison had a honeymoon period after deposing the previous party leader in August 2018. Then the Prime-Minister won the May federal election. His second honeymoon period was soon over. </p>
   
   <p>December 2019. The catastrophic bushfires had been raging across Australia since September. Towns were cut off. buildings destroyed; the east coast looked like an apocalyptic movie. Smoke reached to New Zealand and some claim ash made it to South America. So, Morrison decided it was acceptable to take a family holiday to Hawaii. And he tried to cover it up. Upon being found out he apologised for the error. </p>
   
   <p>January 2020. Returning from his holiday Morrison travelled closer to home. Undertaking photo opportunities in the areas affected by the afore mentioned catastrophic bushfires seemed easy. Then Morrison forced a fire-fighter to shake his hand despite the man's protests. No, means no. The Prime-Minister was not finished. He also forced a woman to shake his hand while she was refusing his advances. Again...no means no. In perfect examples of victim blaming, he promptly suggested they were tired and stressed. After all, their town was in flames. I guess they should have taken a Hawaiian holiday. </p>
   
   
   <p>March 2021. The final report of the Royal Commission into Aged Care is released with the Government promptly had $452 million ready. This is on top of the $537 million allocated in November 2019 after the interim report was delivered. That seems like a lot of money, but it is half of what is expected to be needed. And there was a gap of eighteen months between the announcements. In his statement Morrison said he believes that every life is precious...and waited until the report was released before taking any action despite having advanced warning from the interim report and all the events that warranted the Commission in the first place. Oh, was it mentioned that there was no money available to help the elderly during the election? The budget had to be balanced. Now, during the COVID-19 pandemic, money appears to be falling like rain. It is a pity that could not have happened before the virus spread through aged care facilities. </p>
   
   
   <p>November 2019. Another Royal Commission issue has been bubbling away. Morrison announces that he is actively considering ordering a royal commission into veteran suicide. In December he was only open to the idea. By February he had given up the suggestion. Instead, the Prime-Minister announced a plan for a permanent position to address the issue. More than a year later, in April 2021, Parliament requested a Royal Commission. The Prime-Minister announced the decision as if he had not actively worked against it for more than a year. And the permanent position he had announced? Never happened. </p>
   
   <p>April 2021. In the days before ANZAC Day the Royal Commission into Veteran Suicides was accepted by Parliament. In the days after Morrison announced $580 million to build Australia's armed forces including an increase in the country's long-range strike weapons. A job bonanza! And a likelihood of increasing war related mental illness. When the Royal Commission delivers its findings let us hope there will be money. </p>
   
   <p>April 2021. As the Prime-Minister is doing his pre-election promises tour, previous announcements are being forgotten. It has been reported that Morrison had announced in November that the Government would find funding for a gas fired plant in the Hunter region. His promised deadline is here, and the region is still waiting. </p>
   
   <p>Given this collection of issues is there any need to touch on others? Like that on international women's day 2019 the Prime-Minister announced that women could achieve better success but not at the expense of men. Two years later he ignored a women's rally on violence, down-played rape and sexual abuse in Parliament House and could not immediately accept the recommendations from a report into workplace harassment. To understand these issues the Christian Prime-Minister needed his wife to remind him that he had daughters. </p>
   
   <p>Which brings us back to the Christian meeting in April 2021 where Morrison announced that he lays his hands on people to help alleviate their suffering. Um, again, no. Pray for people in need if you believe it will help. But do not touch them against their will. </p>
   
   <p>Morrison believes these actions of his are doing God's work. Ignoring the vulnerable. Taking credit for other peoples' work. Using remembrance of patriotic veterans as a political tool. Abandoning the leadership post in a time of catastrophic crisis. Forcing others to make physical contact against their wishes. This is God's work? </p>
   
   <p>No. Australia does not have a rational, empathetic leader. This is a man who cannot think for himself. He requires other people to tell him how to behave. His actions are not of a faithful religious warrior, nor of a proud national figurehead. Scott is not a representative of God, sorry, but he is a very naughty boy. </p>
