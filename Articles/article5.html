    <h1> On the Categorisation of the Opposite sex.</h1>
   <h2>by Kevin Anderson | July 2015 (updated 2021) </h2>

   <p>After many years of thinking I decided it is time to write down my thoughts on the how humans perceive the opposite sex. Such a determination of views climaxed in Prague with my interpretations of a woman walking on the other side of the road. It is here that my analysis is grounded with the reality of my observations. </p>

   <p>The first thing to remember is that human attention is primarily attracted by change. If dark becomes light the mind wonders what has caused the change. If a soft sound breaks through a chattering room the ear twitches to establish the origin of such change. So too with movement. If the eye spots movement, then the brain alters focus to understand what the movement is. This intense interest with change can be traced back to the fight or flight instinct of our ancestors. The slightest movement in long grass, the blur of light against a dark sky, even the buzz of a mosquito could be the precursor of an attack by a wild predator. With the instinct still in place deep in the human subconscious it is not surprising that first impressions of the opposite sex are based, not on looks as most psychological thoughts tend to indicate, but on movement in our sphere of vision. </p>
   
   <p>So too with my woman in Prague. Over the top of parked cars with a backdrop of a solid clay wall my eye was caught by brisk movement. The focus was a middle-aged woman with a powerful long stride. Already my words have shifted from initial movement to an assessment of her features and styles. This is the second element in the categorisation of the opposite sex. Acknowledging features is to begin to assess. It starts the internal judgement of image including clothes, hair, height, stride, smell...in fact it is the same with any characteristic that provides an unspoken communication that the observer makes the second assessment of the opposite sex. It is in this realm that beauty lives. The individual viewing the opposite sex makes a judgement as to whether the woman is beautiful or not. Leaving aside how the individual comes to appreciate what beauty is we must turn to the response to the yes/no question: is she beautiful? </p>
   
   <p>More specifically the individual is asking himself is this woman someone I wish to communicate with. If the answer is no, then the individual continues on his way with very little further thought of the woman. This only change if she, or some other external force, alters his assessment with a change of action (e.g.: a further movement such as a flick of her hair or a smile). Alternatively, she may approach and make direct contact with him. So begins another process. If he finds her beautiful, the individual makes another categorisation of the opposite sex: how should I communicate? </p>
   
   <p>It is with this difficult point that the greatest division in classifications occur. Not only are there many forms of communication (e.g.: speaking, smiling, waving, whistling) but there are also many ways in which these communications can be conducted (e.g.: politely, rudely, sexist, arrogantly). And it must be stated that men are not always very good at making the right decision. As such, in brave attempts to make these decisions, the individual must assess and categorise the member of the opposite sex as to which communication style would most appeal to her. That style must also be able to be performed by the individual. For example, it would be impossible to wave a hand if the individual is carrying a shopping bag. So too would nodding if you are rugged up under a scarf and hood. </p>
   
   <p>It is only after these initial non-spoken communications have occurred that an exchange on the intellectual level can begin. In this scenario of first contact only a verbal exchange can allow the analysis and categorisation of a woman's mental faculties. It is not possible to know a woman’s views on climate change, opera, or favourite beverage without conversation. There is no way to reveal her educational background without talking. Yet the process of judging has begun well before the first words. The same holds true of almost any situation where members of the opposite sex meet. Be it at a bar, an online dating site, or a church sermon. After movement, it is the looks of a woman that first create an object for classification. </p>
   
   <p>As such the most important element of human contact appears to be visual. In this light a woman's appearance is essential for men’s ability to guess at what he cannot know. If a woman controls her appearance, then she has greater, but never total, control over which classification she is placed in. A lawyer, a model, a teacher, unemployed? Christian, vegan, activist? How she presents herself precedes conversation. For ever intellectual grouping or sub-culture genre a visual classification has occurred well before her intellectual capacities are engaged. </p>
   
   <p>This understanding of human relations is brief and leaves two questions unasked. The first is a definition of beauty. Why is it that a woman is considered attractive? To answer this, I refer to Bourdieu and his ideas of distinction. Basically, human likes and dislikes are established at a young age through repetition and exposure to variety. We only become aware of new ideas through institutional and social exchanges. Alternatively, if you do not see something you can never know if you like it or not. If you are not acculturated into Australian culture, you may find Vegemite unpalatable. In contrast, if you grow up in a mixed-race neighbourhood you will form direct opinions of the ‘liberal’ agenda. The later in life an individual is exposed to an object, the less likely that individual will approve of an object. Such is therefore the case when advertising presents women as blonde, blue-eyed, long-legged, and big breasted. Young children processing these images are going to enter a positive assumption of these features. If you do not see a redhead, short stature, woman with tattoos then you can not be aware of the possibility of alternative forms of beauty. The conclusion is that external exposure generates an internal definition of beauty. </p>
   
   <p>The other question is...well the other question is how women view men. If I saw a woman on a street in Prague, then there is a possibility that she also saw me. And then she would have undertaken the same categorisation as me...of me. And she kept walking. In fact, every woman I see and judge also judges me: and keeps walking. Women do not engage me. They notice movement, they judge first on appearance. Women do not seek to enter the phase where they can assess my mental capacities. Therefore, I am a reject. I am classified as unworthy either at the phase where beauty is defined or at the stage of engagement techniques. Either I am categorised as ugly or I am categorised as someone who deserves nothing more than a passing glance, even at times a recipient of a disgusting glare. </p>
   
   <p>If ‘women’ as a collective feel objectified, sexualised entities then there is a reason for it. It is necessary during human exchange. After movement alerts the human mind to the possibility of danger, the mind processes the image displayed before it. To linger in the observation is a compliment based upon the initial motives for exchange. The fault is in the ability of men, of humans, to respond appropriately. As an individual who suffers the reverse...there is no acknowledgment of my form...I am unworthy. I can not take solace in the objectifying of the human body for I am de-objectified. I am not even worthy of being valued. Few human relationships get to the point of revealing intelligence or morals. It is so far down the process of communication as to be almost irrelevant. This is the way in which humans classify members of the opposite sex. </p>
