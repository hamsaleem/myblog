    <h1> Preserving jobs through youth movement.</h1>
   <h2>by Kevin Anderson | 10 December 2020 </h2>

      <p>The 2020 Australian budget was always going to be beset with challenges. Almost all issues can be traced to the COVID-19 pandemic. Unprecedented problems arose around a variety of areas including unemployment, the first recession in 30 years, Constitutional discussions on border control, and concerns over supply lines. The Government needed to consider them all.</p>
    
      <p>However great challenges provide great opportunity. Because of the virus the budget was delivered in early October, instead of the customary May. This delay provided the Government with much needed space to learn about the virus itself, to listen to medical experts, to see how Australians reacted to the crisis, and to see how the economy was affected. It also gave time for the Government to consider, organise, plan and structure. In short, there was opportunity to develop solutions to current and future problems.</p>
      <p>Touted on the budget website as “The Economic Recovery Plan for Australia will create jobs, rebuild our economy and secure Australia’s future”, the truth is far from the self-promotional propaganda. In reality the Government delivered a stock, standard, bland budget seemingly devoid of imagination and solutions. </p>
      <p>Economically, one particular policy is worthy of discussion for its lack of short term benefits– Youth training. Specifically the Jobmaker claim is that:
        The Government’s new $4 billion JobMaker Hiring Credit will provide businesses with an 	incentive to take on additional employees aged between 16 and 35 years old. Around 			450,000 positions for young Australians will be supported through the JobMaker Hiring Credit.
    This ‘hiring credit’ is a $200 p/w government payment to employ people 19-29 and $100 p/w for a ‘young person’ aged 30-35. Yes. The Government are now defining young people as those aged 35. Businesses do not receive a bonus if they hire anyone older. Obviously Australians over 35 are deemed unworthy by the Government.
    </p>
      <p>That is the basic fact that is presented in the budget paper. With life expectancy in Australia currently over 80, thirty-five is mathematically not yet middle age. The median age is currently 37.9. Australians with less than three decades of working life ahead of them are considered irrelevant to the Government’s vision of the future.</p>
      <p>Taking the T.A.R.A. approach it is possible to consider other policies that are more inclusive and respectful to hard-working, intelligent Australians. </p>

<p>As a broad stereotyping of individuals more appropriately called ‘youth’. This would be those aged between 16 and 25. Youth in Australia are predominately have less ties. They rarely have home loans, have less children, and are usually employed on a casual basis. The 2020 budget focuses on industry training thereby implying that youth also have not yet accrued a university debt. </p>

<p>In contrast we can create a stereotypical image of the working Australians that the Government consider irrelevant – those over 35. At this point in life Australians have more ties to a specific location. Home loan, family, aging parents, children in school, long-term friends. Middle-age Australians are generally core workers possessing skills and experience that they have provided to their employer for years. They are small business owners, struggling under bureaucracy and insurance regulations. They are farmers providing food for the country. They are stable and established contributors to the nation. It is these workers who have kept the economy strong for twenty years. </p>

<p>These skills already exist. Even as they are stuck in their location these workers should be assisted to do what they have done for their working-life– keep the Australian economy moving. 
With these generalities we can see that the Government budget is wrong. The focus is wrong. </p>

<p>Instead there is another rational policy that can be considered. Shift focus to current workers. Embrace their entrepreneurial skills and utilise youth as active, mobile customers. Consider the better policy in the following way. </p>

<p>Start by providing existing workers training and incentives to develop high-level qualifications. Managerial course and small-business start-up programmes are steps to help an employee become an employer. Existing managers could develop skills in finance or marketing to improve their business as they recover from the pandemic. Simply – upskill those who already have knowledge. </p>

<p>A side point to the current conversation is child-care. Subsidised child-care for middle-age Australians reduces a burden. Free of stress the workers can improve themselves with education and work opportunities such as management or marketing training. These personal improvements lead to better employment opportunities. Ultimately individuals give back to Australia through their knowledge and skills. </p>

<p>With middle-age Australians prepared as workers and employees the small-business section is secure for the next few years. What the newly trained employees need is customers. That is the youth. </p>

<p>Rather than force youth to make life-determining choices in a time of crisis there is a rational alternative to build the Australian economy. Free up the youth. By youthful visitors spending money the tourist businesses stay afloat without direct government benefit. </p>

<p>Unlike those tied to locations and debts the youth are more readily able to travel in Australia. Based on the notion of a ‘gap year’ it is feasible to provide the youth with opportunity to ‘go spend in Australia. It is difficult for a family of four to holiday when their jobs are threatened. It is not so for a youth whose mobility can distribute financial resources around Australia.
At first glance this seems like money for nothing. It is not. It is a rational to government handouts. Yet it bares a multitude of spin-off benefits. This can be broken down at two levels. </p>

<p>First is to ask who the current tourist market is. A casual look at Tourism Australia’s marketing reveals that young, attractive, international travellers are who the industry predominately caters for. Where the bloody hell are, they? This is the reason that the industry has been hard hit but the pandemic. The country is tailored for international backpackers. Providing resources for domestic youth to travel fills a void with a similar product. There is no need for existing, struggling businesses to switch their operations to cater for families, elderly or pets. </p>

<p>The second element is that travel today prepares youth for employment tomorrow. Once pandemic restrictions are eased and Australia welcomes back foreigners, there will be further job opportunities. In upcoming years youth will then be employed in the industries that they personally helped keep afloat. Further, by travelling to these destinations’ youth gain a personal attachment to the regions and can therefore bring new skills to the tourism market over subsequent years. Their skills and knowledge will have been developed. </p>

<p>The beauty of this T.A.R.A. policy is that it can be costed at the same rate as the lame offering from the Government’s 2020 budget– $200 p/w per person under the age of 29 who travels inside Australia. </p>

<p>The focus of this policy is to keep businesses afloat, effectively distribute money around the economy, and open doors for youth into the future. All without abandoning workers older than 35. Even better, unlike the 2020 Budget, this T.A.R.A. policy does so without the government directly influencing the market. </p>
