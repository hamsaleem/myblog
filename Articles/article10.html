    <h1> A future that is certain</h1>
   <h2>by Kevin Anderson | April 2021 </h2>




   <p>What should you do if you can see the future? I do not mean literally. It is not like I have a magic cauldron with misty swirls that give an actual image of where tomorrow will lead. The future I see is one of trajectory. A-B-C-D. As set in momentum as a steam engine on two long metal tracks. As obvious as what goes up having to come down. Often there are social aspects of human interaction that are just as set in their paths. </p>
   
   <p>Sometimes a child's future is not written in the stars but engraved in stone. Etched, if you will, in a mug shot and embroidered on prison overalls. </p>
   
   <p>For active, intelligent youths their future may seem planned to perfection.” I want to be a doctor”” An astronaut”.” A farmer or a dancer”” I want to be like my father”. And if the planets continue to revolve as in the past then the future will be as ordained. </p>
   
   <p>Yet accidents can occur. Tomorrow's doctor slips on ice, suffering an injury that prevents her taking to the operating table to save lives. The astronaut receives and ear infection barring him from ever setting foot in space. These are the luck of the draw where a well-shuffled deck gives a sense of randomness and luck. Despite all preparations all you can do is shrug shoulders, smile, and say” such is life”. </p>
   
   <p>On the other side of the coin there are students who are cursed to remain on the dark side of the road. For some, their actions at school demonstrate that the universe can be depressingly deterministic. It is this future that can be seen. It is here that philosophical questions arise. </p>
       
       <p> What do you do when the future is set, and disaster is assured? </p>
       
       <p>Is death today better than a long-suffering decline? </p>
   
   <p>Words accompany the trajectory.” It is my pen”.” She took my eraser”.” It wasn't me”. These phrases ricochet in the aftermath of books being knocked to the floor, constant talking, stealing items from under noses and wilful tampering with other student's work. Do not forget the eternal favourite of walking the long way through the classroom to distract others (desks are not a labyrinth!). Also echoing in the aftermath is laughter. Childish laughter that thinks such bullying is fun. No matter the number of reprimands the actions remain – learning is absent, development non-existent. </p>
   
   <p>Many of these actions are common to children everywhere (Again, desks are not a labyrinth!). All kids want, and need, attention. They test the boundaries and seek affirmation from peers. For some individuals there is a deeper problem that is never resolved because it is rarely discussed. It is here that the future is clear. </p>
   
   <p>What I see in the future is that stealing and blaming others is associated with fun and seen as entertainment. These continued actions, unstoppable in our little culprit, help predict the future. Yes, there is a single psychopathic kleptomaniac who is the centre of this current discussion. </p>
   
   <p>If one cannot stop a pre-teen stealing then, when he becomes an adult, jail is a sure bet. No. It is not a bet. The odds are unbackable. Unless of course the outcome is worse than jail. If lying and pointing blame for stupid crimes continues then it will not be long before the finger points at the wrong person. </p>
   
   <p>Consider a possible future incident. There is a bag on the ground beside a man in a suit. Our little kleptomaniac thinks it is fun to take the bag. He laughs as he runs away. Within seconds the police have tracked him down and have him in handcuffs. Still laughing he denies responsibility even though the bag is still in his hand. This is the third time this week that he has stolen for fun. A drink from the supermarket on Monday was followed by a shirt on Wednesday. Week-in-week-out the pattern is the same – no learning. </p>
   
   <p>Today is different. There was another man nearby the bag. Our psychopath points the finger:” It wasn't me; it was him.” The police momentarily turn their attention to the second man. We can assume the man does not walk across the road and punch our criminal in the face. However, there is another twist to this story. The second man is a member of the local gang. Drugs, slave trade, and bribery are nothing for him. Even murder is on the cards if the wrong person gets too close to his operations. That has just occurred. Our culprit is now a target for death. </p>
   
   <p>This may seem far-fetched, but several situations have been rolled into a single example. The point is – no learning. The thief is incapable of ceasing his actions. Following from that, the future is certain imprisonment or death. </p>
   
   <p>Given that the mob hit does not terminate the story early, our young criminal is now on trial. Under oath he laughs and tries to take the judge's gavel. At the very least he lies, and perjury now extends his time behind bars. </p>
   
   <p>This is the stone trajectory set out before our student. If no interference occurs, then the future is set. </p>
   
   <p>So now that I know the future, what should I do? You, know as well. What should you do? If it was the present and I saw someone about to die, then the answer is simple. I would save the person. Most people would. </p>
   
   <p>But the future is a different kettle of fish. Many adults dismiss the certainty. Hope can be a dangerous weapon when wielded with naive ideology of if individual freedom. Yet I see the trajectory clear and straight. And I do nothing. My action of in-action is just an indirect cause of death. After all, the adults claim, no one can tell the future so the future can be changed. The individual can change. He just needs time to grow up. </p>
   
   <p>But that is not what I know. I know the train is rolling down the tracks. Is it my concern? Surely someone else could save him. A social worker, a teacher, a psychologist, a painter. Why must I? </p>
   
   <p>The professionals know. The story has been told and retold every week. Parents, teachers, principals meet and smile and say that things will be different tomorrow. If the professionals paid to respond to this situation cannot, or won't, do anything.... then why should I? Jesus never expected Peter to raise Lazareth from the dead. Moses never asked the guy six rows back, third from the left if he could part the Red Sea. David Beckham never pointed to the English goalkeeper and said, 'you take this penalty shot.” It is those who know what they are doing that have the responsibility and the power to affect change. In their view it is not my responsibility. Maybe they are right. </p>
   
   <p>Perhaps not. What if a firefighter says” I’m not going to do anything”? The fire rages all night. Everyone stands and watches. If the professional will not extend the hose and turn on the water, then no one else can. Time to reach for the marshmallows and enjoy the show. But even that analogy is in the present. </p>
   
   <p>If the police see a man enter a bank with guns, should they wait? He has not done anything. The weapons are not concealed. If everyone can see them then someone must have a license. It is only a thought that the bank may be robbed. So, we sit back and wait. If the police don't take action, then no one else should. Two days later the money is in a bag beside a man in a suit. It is watched by our kleptomaniac. </p>
   
   <p>Until then I watch with eyes open at the future burning in front of me. A future that is set in stone. </p>
