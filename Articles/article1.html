    <h1> Beethoven and alternate misuse of history</h1>

    <h2>By Kevin Anderson </h2>

<p>In early 2020 the concept of ‘cancel culture’ was ravaging the accepted understanding of social and moral values. Expanding on ‘Black Lives Matter’ issues of social justice, the basis of cancel culture issues questioned the value of preserving artifacts that presented a model of history that could be considered racist. Examples include ‘blackface’ and statues of colonial explorers. By October 2020 cancel culture had reached into the world of classical music. In an opinion-piece Nate Sloan and Charlie Harding questioned the validity of Ludvig Von Beethoven. And the slanging match began. </p>

<p>Before discussing Beethoven it is necessary to be a bit more specific on what ‘cancel culture’ is. At its broadest the idea is about rejecting ideas that disagree with your own opinion. At a more practical level it is accepting that much of history has been distorted to favour certain economic and racial groups. Yet there is a political motive as well. Importantly, the name itself is a derogatory term, touted directly by right-wing ideologues as being a product of the ‘loony left’. </p>

<p>Such trolling is designed to immediately discredit the idea being discussed. Ironically then, calling a subject part of the ‘loony left’s cancel culture’ is an underhanded technique to cancel the leftist ideals. The trolling is also an attack on free speech. For example, Christopher Columbus is sacred, and no one is allowed to question his actions. </p>

<p>In his blog ‘Beethoven to the Guillotine’, Lulchek even states that he is a Beethoven lover and bemoans that Sloane & Harding want people to view the music sceptically and not love it unconditionally. In-other-words Lulchek wants you to love Beethoven without thinking. </p>

<p>To avoid this censorship it is important to acknowledge the two positive driving forces behind ‘cancel culture’. First is that it is an opportunity to explore the past and acknowledge forgotten people who changed the world. Without prompting do modern publics remember Rosalind Franklin or Deborah Cheetham? Second is that acknowledging outdated social rituals allows for modern generations to create their own history that reflects new social parameters. By doing so, history becomes a democratic tool and reflects changing social values. Without this challenge women would still be trapped as housewives and Aborigines in Australia would remain without the right to vote. </p>

<p>If we froze the values in the year Beethoven wrote the 5th the world would be a different place. Not to mention that if Beethoven did not question the music of his era then he would not have written ground-breaking symphonies. </p>

<p>It is therefore essential that no censorship is placed upon the ability of groups to question the idols of the past. That does not mean statues should be illegally destroyed nor. Violence in all aspects should be denied. Modern humans should be better than that. We should claim that our civilisation has risen to the point where disputes can be resolved with articulate, reasoned discussion. </p>

<p> However this means that censorship of discussion should stop. The conservative commentators should stop trolling the liberal leftists and begin providing logical arguments as to why certain white men should be memorialised. A good start would be explaining why the United States of America worships Columbus when the explorer never set foot on the national shores. </p>

<p> ‘Canceling Beethoven is the latest woke madness for the classical-music world’. This is the title of a September opinion piece by Johnathon S Tobin in the New York Post. He is not the only commentator to rush to Beethoven’s defence. Lelchuk is another. So are both Lawson and Cash. Their arguments focus on the Sloan and Harding opinion piece at vox.com and all claim that the Vox authors are woke liberal leftists trying to silence fee-speech. So, is that claim correct? Focusing on Tobin’s rebuttal there are at least two examples that will serve to outline the problem at hand and open the door for better conversation. </p>

<p> From the title of the Sloan & Harding article it is clear that Tobin is being misleading. ‘How Beethoven’s 5th Symphony put the classism in classical music’. There is no mention of cancelling Beethoven, only pointing to the shift in cultural attitudes relating to music in the 1800’s. A single sentence in the article points to a disenfranchisement of minority groups. But, throughout the article, Sloan & Harding make several points that Lelchuck agrees with. There seems to be little doubting the complexity of the 5th and that the piece reshaped how concert attendees interacted with the music. Prime among these is that Beethoven almost single-handedly prevented applause in mid-performance. Far from wanting to cancel Beethoven, the authors acknowledge his genius and influence. </p>

<p> There is no reason for derogatory name-calling and trolling.</p>

<p>Sloan & Harding do however point out a dilemma. If we keep worshipping Beethoven, then it is easy to overlook modern composers. This is not an obscure phenomenon. Parties and festivals are filled with music from the Beatles, Bee Gees and Village People. Donald Trump even attempted to dance to YMCA in 2020. DJ’s at sporting venues get some of the biggest reactions from Sweet Caroline. These classic hits are blended in with Ariana, Beyonce, and One Direction. </p>

<p>The fact is that people enjoy music they grew up with as well as music that has spanned the test of time. Be it Mozart or Elvis. Only our grandchildren have the right and ability to determine if Taylor Swift will join these ranks. It is not for today’s commentators to freeze the pinnacle of music with the Beatles or Queen*. </p>
<p>It is also worth noting that there was as many protests the Beatles and Elvis as there were celebrations for their ability to shape public appreciation of music. In fact, many in the older generation today were part of the ‘woke’ 1960’s youth who fought against the censorship of their parents. Without the questioning of the music system there would be no Beatles and the modern music revolution. Imagine that. </p>

</p>Nothing stated so far implies that the older songs should be cancelled. It is a recognition that space needs to be granted to talented new generations. The conversations should therefore be about how much space and what sort of music? </p>

<p> Yet Tobin is even more dishonest. He tries to link the authors to the most violent protests and extreme aspects of racist movements. This not what the authors are saying. Their argument has nothing to do with ‘woke’ ideas, nor in a direct sense about gender equality. Even more outlandish is Tobin’s claim that: 
	<blockquote> <p>The war on Western civilization will leave nothing sacred untouched. If 				Beethoven can be cancelled, nothing is safe. </blockquote> </p>
There is no attack on western civilisation. Beethoven is not being cancelled. </p>

<p>Tobin is trolling to scare his readers. This is not logical, reasoned discussion. </p>

<p>Again, a simple glance at Sloan & Harding’s article shows they are asking more important questions. Where are modern composers getting opportunities? Moreover, how do we know if any modern composer is better than Beethoven if we never listen to the new generation? How do we know if we do not think critically? </p>

<p>There is therefore an essential question that all parents should ask. If the NY Philharmonic Orchestra are focused on Beethoven, then where will my daughter get her break as a composer? </p>



<p>Another key component of reasoned discussion is to ensure that facts are correct. Given the deceptiveness of the trolling by Tobin, it would be wise for him to have his own argument in order. He tries to increase Beethoven’s value to the world with an interesting point. Tobin states unequivocally that: 
<blockquote> <p> "It is no coincidence that the opening notes of his Fifth Symphony — whose 			rhythmic pattern duplicates the Morse Code notation for the letter “V” as in “V for 			Victory” — were used by the BBC for broadcasts to occupied Europe during the Second World War." </p> </blockquote>
