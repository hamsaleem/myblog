    <h1> Beethoven– debate without trolling </h1>
   <h2>By Kevin Anderson | 10 December 2020 </h2>
   | 
    
   <p>In the middle of September 2020 an article was published on vox.com promoting a podcast that would analyse Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony and the man’s contribution to the world. The title was provocative– ‘How Beethoven’s 5th Symphony put the classism in classical music’. It started an outcry. Perhaps it was intended to. </p>

   <p>Unfortunately, few who responded did so without lowering their own standards of debate. Many articles opened with comments about wokeness, cancel culture, and pointed to the ‘looney left’. None of these derogatory terms have anything to do with the article. </p>
   
   <p>Moving beyond this basic framing, it is necessary to discuss some of the arguments presented by several of the commentators who have responded to Sloan & Harding’s article on the Vox website. One of these is Lulchek, a cellist and confessed Beethoven lover. </p>
   
   <p>This raises and interesting question. Is someone better able to analyse a subject that they are familiar with, or one that they have no real connection with? Obviously if one is ignorant then speaking would be ill advised. Yet so too would speaking if the attachment is too great. A husband can not be expected to accurately critique his wife. A dog breeder could also be considered biased if discussing the value of cats. </p>
   
   <p>The issue itself is not important if handled correctly. However, Lulchek accuses the Vox authors of forcing out ‘new program content’ and thereby restraining the desires, interests and choices of the public. The dilemma is that he tries to walk the line between freedom and forcing his own love of Beethoven onto the public. It is possible to argue that the public democratically choose to listen to Beethoven, but it is not the public who choose the playlist for a concert. There is a negotiation between orchestras and public as to what is played and when. </p>
   
   <p>A bigger point that must be made is that Lulchek calls for an increase in funding for classical arts. In a free market there is no need for government funding. The public will pay to watch classical music. If they are not, then there is an issue to be addressed that is not related to whether Beethoven was ‘woke’*. </p>
   
   <p>Funding is one element of the classical culture that Sloan & Harding point to. Their bigger focus is on the culture of classical concerts with etiquette and politeness. This issue has proved problematic for commentators responding to the claim. Lulchek claims there is no strict culture in classical concerts. Cosh says that snootiness is an issue that orchestras are trying to deal with. He points out that many plays in parks to passing joggers and picnickers. Lawson devotes his entire article to explaining that there is formal culture and why it is necessary. </p>
   
   <p>Sloan & Harding’s point is about inclusiveness, the things we do to belong to a group. The article is a short introduction to the third of four podcasts. It does not have the space to expand on the concepts**. However, there is an irony in how commentators have responded to the article. </p>
   
   <p>Lawson goes a long way to proving the point that Sloan & Harding were making. He states that classical concerts teach respect, restraint and reverence. Aspects that he sees as lacking in modern society. He even suggests that attending a classical concert could be used as a special reward for children. </p>
   
   <p>Lawson is claiming that if more people behaved like they do at classical concerts the world would be a better place. Etiquette includes starting on time and not shouting when the music is playing. Attendees should also stay for the whole event out of respect for the efforts of the musicians. Even if the music is terrible. Unfortunately, that is a denial of the freedom of expression and the right to protest. This form of etiquette can be used to distort statistics for if everyone stays to the end then the concert must have been good. There is no dissent. That is not etiquette, that is authoritarian control. </p>
   
   <p>Lawson explains that it is manners that set people apart from their peers. Manners that, like Sloan & Harding explain, were created by a growing industrial middle-class that was creating a society different to that of farmers and workers. In short, Lawson is saying: This way is better– that way is worse. That is the very definition of elitism. He indicates that what middle-class people do is better than what working-class people do. That is the very definition of classism. So, Lawson has presented a convincing moral based argument that Beethoven’s music is supported by an elitist, classist culture. </p>
   
   <p>Lulchek comes close to doing the same. He tells a personal story of playing Beethoven to a Filipino hotel worker in Qatar. The man burst into tears after listening to the glory of the German composer. Lulchek does not tell of whether he had the opportunity to listen to Filipino music nor of his reflections on that genre. He has no need. He has already announced that his ‘precious’ Beethoven is the greatest composer of all time. There are few better examples of a white saviour than this story. </p>
   
   <p>Beyond individual attempts to discredit any analysis of classical music, there are two broad failings that reduce the quality of debate. First is the use of logical fallacies. </p>
   
   <p>Lawson resorts to hyperbole. His intended exaggeration is that, taking the top ten composers, a decade of concerts could play without repetition. Beethoven made nine symphonies. That’s about 20 hours, the same in concerts. At one concert a week and adding his small pieces, that is about half a year. If we calculate the same for the other nine composers, then there is only enough material for five years without repetition. Lawson is clearly exaggerating for effect. </p>
   
   <p>Lulcheck introduces his readers to the slippery slope argument. If people are asking questions today, then tomorrow they will be burning the musical scores. This is a false claim aimed at linking the authors of the Vox article with Nazi burning of books. There is no logical connection between asking questions, presenting a valid opinion and atrocities. It should also be remembered that slippery slope arguments were used against Elvis and the downfall of American society. </p>
   
   <p>Both hyperbole and slippery slope arguments are therefore used to emotionally motive readers rather than actively engage with the discussion. The bigger decline of debate is who commentators feel the need to through derogatory attacks at the authors of the Vox article. </p>
   
   <p>Lawson points to radical, left, neo-Marxist hysteria. Lulcheck bemoans the quality of liberal arts colleges and accuses the authors of using the authoritarian playbook to manipulate the public***. Cosh resorts to identifying the website rather than the authors as ‘trolls and nitwits’. It must be asked, if your argument is strong enough to prove your point, then why throw insults? Why try and create fear of an non-existence impending collapse of civilisation? Just stick to the debate and engage with the conversation. </p>
   
   <p>Having said that, there are interesting points that the commentators make. Lawson says that many concerts play new compositions before an intermission. If this is true, then it is a strong argument against Sloan & Harding’s desire to increase opportunities for younger composers. More statistics and input is obviously required. </p>
   
   <p>Most importantly is a point that both sides agree on. Beethoven’s Fifth, like much of his work, is a masterpiece. With that point of agreement there is no need for either side to claim ‘cancel culture’ or censor debates. Instead, as Maddy Shaw writes:
    <blockquote> <p> As such a giant of the music, there is absolutely no reason we can’t have a 	debate about [Beethoven’s] impact on it. </p> </blockquote>
  <p>If we ask questions then have a serious and intelligent discussion it is possible to find that Beethoven is greater than originally thought. </p>
   
  
*I am aware that there is no direct correlation between economic ideology and many commentators’ viewpoints about wokeness. The point on economic control is however relevant to the wider discussion of attendance and accessibility of classical music. It also demonstrates that, no matter how good Beethoven is, there is a financial barrier. <br>

** I am aware that their conversations in the podcasts do not necessarily agree with my defence of them here. I am, in the first-hand, discussing the article because many commentators cite that as the primary source.<br>

*** Before you criticise, read carefully what I have written. Lulchek directly attacks the authors without evidence. I define the argument and process of authoritarian control and point at that.
