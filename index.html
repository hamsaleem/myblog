I have taken action, steps towards understanding the contractions in the great southern land. My words are placed here for all to see. Each sentence edges me ever nearer to home. Every paragraph considered an Australia where there is an optimistic hope for tomorrow's heroes. If anyone is willing to listen.</p>
