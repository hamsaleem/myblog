    <h1><a href="about.html" id="intro">Kevin who?</a></h1>

    <h2>Everyting needs an intro!</h2>

<p>Kevin is a man with a split heart. A third of his life has been spent in Brisbane, a third moving around Western Australia, and a third in Sweden. He has lived in remote areas, regional localities and capital cities. </p>

<p>Kevin has worked with government agencies, local councils and schools. Since first coaching his sister's junior netball team he has followed a passion for improving opportunities for sport including founding the Australian Rules Football team in Karlstad, Sweden. He is also an ongoing supporter of charity organisations and a member of a local United Nations Association branch. </p>

<p>Among the broad field of humanity and political science education, Kevin has courses and degrees in inter-cultural communication, policy analysis and anthropology. The peak of these is a Master of Community Development from Murdoch University. He his currently working on a Master of History at Karlstad University. </p>

<p>Filled with thoughts and theories Kevin is not comfortable in a black/white world. He believes there are always alternatives to any situation. Often the best choices are the ones made against the flow of norms or popular opinion. Kevin also likes finding the unspoken or unseen in the shadows and bringing their true form into light. </p>

<p>From this perspective he is writing the biography of Eva-Lisa Holtz, the woman whose reputation lies behind the icon of a city: Sola-i-Karlstad. </p>
