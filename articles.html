    <p class="note"> Wisdom can't be achieved by sitting down and thinking. Wisdom is an action. Only by getting out and living your life can you become wise. Once we start living the obvious becomes clear. That which we embrace and that which we fear are often different only by how far we open our mind. </p>

    <h1><a href="/Articles/article1.html"> <small> Beethoven and alternate misuse of history </small>  </a></h1>
    <h2>By Kevin Anderson | 10 December 2020 </h2>
    <p>
      <small> In early 2020 the concept of ‘cancel culture’ was ravaging the accepted understanding of social and moral values. Expanding on ‘Black Lives Matter’ issues of social justice, the basis of cancel culture issues questioned the value of preserving artifacts that presented a model of history that could be considered racist. Examples include ‘blackface’ and statues of colonial explorers. By October 2020 cancel culture had reached into the world of classical music. In an opinion-piece Nate Sloan and Charlie Harding questioned the validity of Ludvig Von Beethoven. And the slanging match began.

    <h1><a href="/Articles/article2.html"> <small> Beethoven– debate without trolling</small>  </a></h1>
    <h2>By Kevin Anderson | 10 December 2020</h2>
    <p> <small>In the middle of September 2020 an article was published on vox.com promoting a podcast that would analyse Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony and the man’s contribution to the world. The title was provocative– ‘How Beethoven’s 5th Symphony put the classism in classical music’. It started an outcry. Perhaps it was intended to.

    <h1><a href="/Articles/article3.html"> <small> Preserving jobs through youth movement</small>  </a></h1>
    <h2>By Kevin Anderson | 10 December 2020</h2>
    <p> <small>  The 2020 Australian budget was always going to be beset with challenges. Almost all issues can be traced to the COVID-19 pandemic. Unprecedented problems arose around a variety of areas including unemployment, the first recession in 30 years, Constitutional discussions on border control, and concerns over supply lines. The Government needed to consider them all.

    <h1><a href="/Articles/article4.html"> <small> Call of Twitter: Lovecraft, IT and social media</small>  </a></h1>
    <h2>By Kevin Anderson | January 2021</h2>
    <p> <small> So begins the Call of Cthulhu. The short story by H.P. Lovecraft has spawned everything from fan-sites and computer games to a fanatical following, some of whom believe the tale is real. A century after he typed these words perhaps the human mind has voyaged far enough across the seas of science that the disconnect between moral and knowledge has snapped for all eternity. In a week where the President of the United States has been prohibited from speaking on social media, it is time to consider how near humans are to fleeing into the safety of a new dark age

    <h1><a href="/Articles/article5.html"> <small> On the Categorisation of the Opposite sex.</small>  </a></h1>
    <h2>By Kevin Anderson | July 2015 (updated 2021)</h2>
    <p> <small>  After many years of thinking I decided it is time to write down my thoughts on the how humans perceive the opposite sex. Such a determination of views climaxed in Prague with my interpretations of a woman walking on the other side of the road. It is here that my analysis is grounded with the reality of my observations.

    <h1><a href="/Articles/article7.html"> <small> A gesture on a train.</small>  </a></h1>
    <h2>By Kevin Anderson | April 2021 </h2>
    <p> <small>  Picture the setting. A train, north bound out of Brisbane. Not just a local train travelling a few kilometres. This is a train that will hold its passengers in a steel embrace for nearly three hours. Ok, so it is the same type of train that covers smaller routes, it was just scheduled for a longer trip. But you have an image of how a long-distance train works. It stops every few minutes, on and on, for longer than a football match.

    <h1><a href="/Articles/article8.html"> <small> Separate, Erase and Rewrite.</small>  </a></h1>
    <h2>By Kevin Anderson | April 2021 </h2>
    <p> <small>  When I was younger a scandal rocked the music world. The King of Pop had been accused of child molestation. Michael Jackson jokes circulated the world in what would today make him the King of Memes. What do Michael Jackson and McDonald's have in common? Both are a forty-year-old piece of meat between ten-year-old buns.

    <h1><a href="/Articles/article9.html"> <small> Scomo- The messenger of God</small>  </a></h1>
    <h2>By Kevin Anderson | April 2021 </h2>
    <p> <small> 28 April 2021. The Australian Prime-Minister Scott Morrison, Scomo to his friends, spoke at a Christian gathering. That's fine, as leader of the country he should attend, speak and listen to all groups. It is his job. Unfortunately, Morrison's words were not as patriotic as he might like to think. He decided to tell the world that he is doing God's work.

    <h1><a href="/Articles/article10.html"> <small> A future that is certain</small>  </a></h1>
    <h2>By Kevin Anderson | April 2021 </h2>
    <p> <small> What should you do if you can see the future? I do not mean literally. It is not like I have a magic cauldron with misty swirls that give an actual image of where tomorrow will lead. The future I see is one of trajectory. A-B-C-D. As set in momentum as a steam engine on two long metal tracks. As obvious as what goes up having to come down. Often there are social aspects of human interaction that are just as set in their paths.
